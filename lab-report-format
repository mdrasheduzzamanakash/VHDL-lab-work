	title
	Objectives
	Hardware requirements and software requirements 
	What is Structural design 
		structural design basic 
		Explanation of structural design 
	A - B and how it all are happening in different steps 
		How to do complement of 2
		How to subtruct using complement of 2
		New component defination using VHDL(NOT gate)
		Performing the operation 
		
		
		
		*** Karnug Map 
		*** sequential vs combinational circuit
		*** why clock edge is used instead of the clock rise or clock down
		
		
		
		3. Next Lab ::
		T flip flop
		D flip flop
		4 bit register => |D/T/JK | D/T/JK | D/T/JK | D/T/JK| -> must do with D flipflop
		
		
	Next lab---
		4 bit Shift register design
		reg-val       input
		0101          0 ==== 1010
		1010          1 ==== 0101
		0101          0 ==== 1010
